Redis Enterprise Software (RES) helps you overcome the limitations of
open source Redis. It provides scalable Redis databases, even for
datasets larger than the largest server. Moreover, it scales without the
hassle of setting up or dealing with nodes and clusters, while
maintaining the same endpoints.

Achieving true high-availability is very easy with RES. At the click of
a button, you can set up in-memory replication, data persistence, and
remote backups.

You get all of that, plus the code you already have works. The same
code, the same Redis client. We use them too.

And finally, it is fully automated, so you do not need to worry about
scaling or recovery from failures.
