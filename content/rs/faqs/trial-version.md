You can use, experience and administer the full capabilities of Redis
Enterprise Software (RES), but you may not deploy it in a production
environment. In addition, the trial version allows a maximum of four
shards and is limited to thirty (30) days of use after initial
installation on the first server in the cluster. After the thirty day
trial, the cluster will shift to read-only status. The free version does
not provide the same support options as the paid version. Finally, no
SLA is provided with the trial version. To continue operation of the
cluster with full capabilities, you must purchase a [subscription
cluster key from Redis Labs](/pricing/).
