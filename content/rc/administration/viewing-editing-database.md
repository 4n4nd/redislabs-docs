To view your database, go to the Menu and click on "Databases". You will
see a list of your databases grouped by
[Subscription](/redis-cloud-documentation/administration/setup-editing/create-subscription/).

![Viewing databases in
UI](/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/databases_main.png){.alignnone
.wp-image-26959 .size-full width="600" height="366"}

In this view, you have pertinent information about each database and
some of its features. Since a
[Subscription](/redis-cloud-documentation/administration/setup-editing/create-subscription/)
can have multiple databases, you can add one to a Subscription by
clicking on the "**+**" below each Subscription table.

On the "View Database" page you will see four important icons next to
the title of the page:

-   The pencil icon is for [editing the database](#edit-database)
-   The trash can is for deleting the database
-   The arrow icon is for [importing
    data](/redis-cloud-documentation/how-to/importing-dataset-redis-cloud/)
    into the database
-   The clock is for [backing up the
    database](/redis-cloud-documentation/administration/configuration/backups/)
    (if backups are already configured)

To Edit a database, click on the pencil icon.

on the pencil icon to edit the database. This view allows you to edit
the database settings just as they were when the database was created.\

Database](/redis-cloud-documentation/administration/setup-editing/creating-databases/).
